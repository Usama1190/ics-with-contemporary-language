## Practical: Loops in Python

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

---

### Example 1: For Loop with `range()`
```python
# Prints numbers from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

### Summary Table

| Keyword    | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `for`      | Repeats for a known number of times |
| `while`    | Repeats until a condition is false  |
| `break`    | Exits the loop early                |
| `continue` | Skips the current iteration         |
