# Algorithms & Flowcharts

## What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a set of step-by-step instructions used to solve a specific problem or perform a task. Algorithms are the core of computer programming and logic building.

### Real-Life Analogy:

Think of a cooking recipe:

* Step 1: Boil water
* Step 2: Add pasta
* Step 3: Cook for 10 minutes
* Step 4: Drain and serve

This is an algorithm for making pasta.

### Key Characteristics of an Algorithm:

* **Input**: Takes 0 or more inputs
* **Output**: Produces at least one output
* **Definiteness**: Clear, unambiguous instructions
* **Finiteness**: Ends after a finite number of steps
* **Effectiveness**: Each step can be carried out

### Example: Find the Largest of Two Numbers

```
Step 1: Start  
Step 2: Read two numbers A and B  
Step 3: If A > B, then print A is larger  
Step 4: Else print B is larger  
Step 5: Stop
```

## What is a Flowchart?

A **flowchart** is a diagram that represents an algorithm or process. It uses **symbols** to show steps and their order in solving a problem.

### Why Use Flowcharts?

* Helps visualize the logic
* Makes debugging easier
* Good for planning before coding

### Common Flowchart Symbols:

| Symbol        | Meaning              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Oval          | Start or End         |
| Rectangle     | Process or Operation |
| Parallelogram | Input or Output      |
| Diamond       | Decision (Yes/No)    |
| Arrow         | Flow of control      |

## Example: Flowchart to Find Even or Odd Number

**Steps:**

1. Start
2. Input a number
3. Divide number by 2
4. If remainder is 0 → Even
5. Else → Odd
6. End

(You can draw this manually or use tools mentioned below.)

## How Algorithms and Flowcharts Work Together

1. **Start with an algorithm** (write the logic in steps)
2. **Translate into a flowchart** (draw the logical flow visually)
3. **Convert to code** (implement in Python, C++, etc.)

## Architecture Flow

* **Problem** → Describe clearly
* **Algorithm** → Write steps
* **Flowchart** → Visual diagram of logic
* **Code** → Translate into a programming language
* **Run** → Get output and debug if needed

## Real-World Applications

| Area            | Use of Algorithms & Flowcharts         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Banking Systems | ATM withdrawal steps, transaction flow |
| Gaming          | Game character movements & decisions   |
| Websites        | Login authentication, form validation  |
| Mobile Apps     | User interaction logic                 |
| AI/ML           | Training models with step-wise logic   |

## Practice Tasks

1. Write an algorithm to find the largest of three numbers
2. Create a flowchart for a calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
3. Convert a real-world activity (e.g., making tea) into a flowchart
